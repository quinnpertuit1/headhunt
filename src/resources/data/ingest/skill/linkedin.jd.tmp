  <p><strong>Who we are</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>We're building the future of retail, enabled through technology. Come talk to us if you’re interested in creating lightweight single-responsibility apps, building advanced Javascript MV*-powered front-ends, leveraging graph databases and machine learning, and creating amazing user experiences for users both internal and external. </p> 
  <p>We are polyglots, using the best tool for the problem at hand. You’ll see languages and technologies like Ruby, Sidekiq, ES6, React, Postgres with hstore and json, Sinatra, Redis, Swift, Android, Docker, Ansible, and Elastic Search. </p> 
  <p>Most importantly we want developers that have a keen business sense and an entrepreneurial attitude. We work directly with the business to build solutions that solve real problems and want developers that can thrive in an environment where you’re in the driver’s seat to create something amazing. </p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>Who you are</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>You’re comfortable building software solutions and systems – and love the value created in the business by doing so. You’ve got solid coding chops and&nbsp;strive&nbsp;to use&nbsp;the best tool for the job. We welcome new ideas and technologies – you’ll be critical in deciding exactly what technologies we use. You’re comfortable working in and/or&nbsp;leading teams – and have done so in the past, understand and appreciate the value of test-driven development, and love to work in an agile and rapid environment. </p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>How we work</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>We are a rapidly growing team of smart and passionate engineers. We like people who think independently and feel comfortable helping to drive the direction of the products they work on. We’re not tied to a particular technology or solution – that’s what you bring. </p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>We pair</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>We frequently pair program. We work at pairing stations - two keyboards, two monitors, one mind. We work in an open team room; no cubicles or private offices. We believe software development is a collaborative process, where communication is key. </p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>We work with agility</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>&quot;Agile&quot; means a lot of different things to different people these days, and quite frankly doesn't hold much weight at face value. We don’t believe in following a process for process’ sake. We ship frequently and focus on delivering incremental value – day by day, week by week, we make the company better. </p> 
  <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong> </p> 
  <p><strong>Most importantly, we value our people</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>We spend time regularly working on whatever we’re interested in. We invest in our people by creating opportunities that combine our interests with what the company needs. We have lunch-and-learns, hack days, team outings, and encourage personal learning projects. Oh yeah, and we’ve got a forty-foot long bar. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Interested?</p>

  Winooski Recreation is running a snack program for Saturday soccer and is looking for a parent volunteer to help distribute the snacks every Saturday. The snacks will be distributed between 10:00 and 10:30, during the break between K-2 practice and 3-5 practice. The volunteer will be provided with a master attendee for soccer participants and will record each child that receives a snack. As the snacks are reimbursed through the Child and Adult Care Food Program, proper documentation is essential. The city will purchase and provide the snacks at the soccer field, so the volunteer will just need to set them up, distribute them, and record those who took a snack. This is a great opportunity for a parent whose child is participating in soccer and is looking for something to do during practice! 
  <br /> 
  <br />Please note that since we are operating on a reimbursement model through CACFP, volunteers will need to complete 2 hours of training on nutrition and/or food preparation. Trainings are available either in-person or through online courses, and are very straightforward.

  <p><strong>SUMMARY:</strong>&nbsp;The Data Journalist analyzes and shares data for enterprise and investigative reports, as well as revelatory breaking news, for use across the USA Today Network. We’re looking for a data journalist who is an investigative reporter at heart, who loves to find and dig into unique data stories, and has the skill to clean, analyze and develop a wide variety of data sets. Unlike many data-journalist positions, working for the USA TODAY Network’s team requires thinking both nationally and locally and collaborating with local journalists representing more than 100 local newsrooms. The entire country is our data and investigations playground, which presents exciting opportunities and unique data challenges that require flexibility and determination. This position is part of the Network’s Data &amp; Joint Investigations team, and can be based in McLean, VA, or at another local Gannett site. </p> 
  <p><br /><strong>KEY JOB DUTIES:</strong> </p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Obtain and analyze government and commercially available data to support revelatory enterprise and investigative stories for use nationally and locally, across the USA Today Network. Collaborate with journalists coast to coast to build exclusive, custom data sets. </li> 
   <li>Help local Gannett journalists, working with our data, to identify the best angles for unique, revealing stories for their local audience or state. </li> 
   <li>Report and write original investigative or data-driven stories for use across the Network. Stories may be deep dives or spin off breaking news; you may sometimes do your own reporting and writing, or work with a large team of reporters, depending on the project. </li> 
   <li>For USA Today Network enterprise, assist in development and continued improvement of the data and supporting “help packages” provided to local journalists in advance of national/collaborative stories to improve both pick-up and the quality of local work. </li>

  <p><strong>Director, Asia Operations</strong> </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Engineered to think. </p> 
  <p>In a world… where science fiction is constantly making promises that actual science can’t deliver. Where phone booths don’t teleport themselves, and zero calorie beer has yet to exist. One company had the courage to stand up and say, “Hey! Science! Where’s my jetpack?” </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Hi. We’re Anki. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>When our Co-Founders Boris, Mark and Hanns met in the Ph.D program at Carnegie Mellon’s Robotics Institute, they didn’t dream about artificial intelligence that sends you speeding tickets in the mail, or shrink wraps shrink-wrap. They were united by a shared habit of saying “Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if...?” &nbsp;then actually making that cool thing happen. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Now, we know what you’re thinking: we’re just another all black-wearing, white cat-stroking bunch of weirdos designing laser-powered panini machines in an underground lair somewhere. Nope. Anki is made up of non-crazy people building crazy-cool AI and robotics that are reinventing physical entertainment. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Sound crazy? Maybe. But crazy-in-a-good-way. Maybe that’s why Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced our first product, Anki Drive, in his keynote at WWDC in June 2013. And why top-tier VC’s including Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures, and Two Sigma trust us with their money. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Anki is taking years of fancy research and incomprehensible 1’s and 0’s and turning them into exciting things that people actually want. Things they want real bad. Things they didn’t even think could exist. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Imagine impossible interactive experiences. Imagine video games in real life. Imagine jetpacks. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>And we’re just getting started. </p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p></p> 
  <p>Excited? Us too. Visit the Anki website and find us on Facebook and YouTube to find out more about Anki - the future of consumer robotics and entertainment. </p>

   <li>Making sure that our office always looks its best</li> 
   <li>Helping with IT and equipment issues (don’t worry, we won’t expect you to know how to set up a firewall...but you should be able to figure out how to hire someone who does).</li>

   <br /> 
  </ul>

  <strong>About Arrow Environmental Services<br /><br /></strong>Arrow Environmental Services is a leader in sustainable solutions for termite and pest control, and lawn care services around the Southeast, building on a family tradition established more than 100 years ago. Arrow offers residential and commercial pest control; termite control; Thermal Acoustical Pest-control (TAP) insulation application; lawn, tree and shrub care; and irrigation in west and central Florida, while our partner companies Bug Out Service in Jacksonville and Skyline Pest Solutions in Atlanta deliver quality service in those areas. We guarantee customer satisfaction to the fullest extent. 
  <br /> 
  <br />The roots of what would become Arrow Environmental Services date back to 1886, when a man named George Pickhardt founded one of the nation's first pest control services near Buffalo, New York. His son, Vern, established Arrow Environmental in Sarasota in 1958, making it one of west Florida's first and longest-established, pest control service companies. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Now under the direction of George's grandson and namesake, company Chairman George Pickhardt, Arrow Environmental Services operates in more than 100 communities in west-central and southwest Florida. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Arrow has been - and continues to be - one of the fastest-growing pest control companies in the nation, as more and more customers join a company built on quality customer service and personal relationships. 
  <br /> 
  <br />We focus on sustainable practices, being especially mindful of the safety of children and pets. Our collaborative style means that we take a wide-ranging approach to addressing your pest control issues.

Celebrating 10 years of service in our community, Colorado Youth for a Change is solving Colorado’s dropout crisis.

Samen met de klanten (en je collega’s) ontwikkel je systemen en koppelingen die het mogelijk maken om het beste dat zij te bieden hebben, veilig en betrouwbaar digitaal te delen met bijvoorbeeld partners of externe developers.

Daarbij is het noodzakelijk inzicht te hebben in de vele mogelijke platformen om een stabiele en betrouwbare infrastructuur neer te zetten. Anderzijds zijn er contacten met de diverse functionele afdelingen, waarvoor de informatiestromen bij elkaar gebracht worden. De <strong>Integratie Consultant</strong> legt de brug tussen de diverse disciplines.<br />&nbsp;<br />Als <strong>Integratie Consultant</strong> sta je zowel analytisch als communicatief sterk in je schoenen; je bent immers het (technische) visitekaartje bij de klant. Je komt te werken in een team met gedreven collega’s (en je werkt vaak bij de klant op locaties), waarin samenwerken en kennisdelen voorop staan.</p> 
  <br /> 
  <strong>Agreements</strong> 
  <br /> 
  <p><strong>Wat kun je verwachten?</strong></p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>Een zeer uitdagende functie bij een dynamische en snelgroeiende organisatie in de IT-sector</li> 
   <li>Zelfstandig &eacute;n in teams werken</li> 
   <li>Individuele verantwoordelijkheid</li> 
   <li>Technisch uitdagend werk 
    <ul> 
     <li>Oplossen van veelzijdige problematieken, op het gebied van:</li> 
     <li>Security</li> 
     <li>Integratie</li> 
    </ul></li> 
   <li>Verschillende betrokken partijen</li> 
   <li>Doorgroeimogelijkheden in een snelgroeiende organisatie</li> 
   <li>Mooie klanten en uitdagende projecten</li> 
   <li>Ruimte om mee te bouwen aan zichtbare projecten</li> 
   <li>Informele en open bedrijfscultuur</li> 
   <li>Goede beloning, afgestemd op je rol, ervaring en prestaties</li> 
   <li>Goede secundaire voorwaarden, waaronder een winstdelingsregeling en een aandelenplan</li> 
   <li>Beschikking over alle hulpmiddelen en faciliteiten om prettig te kunnen werken, zoals een laptop, smartphone en flexibele vervoersregeling</li>

  <strong>About Arrow Environmental Services<br /><br /></strong>Arrow Environmental Services is a leader in sustainable solutions for termite and pest control, and lawn care services around the Southeast, building on a family tradition established more than 100 years ago. Arrow offers residential and commercial pest control; termite control; Thermal Acoustical Pest-control (TAP) insulation application; lawn, tree and shrub care; and irrigation in west and central Florida, while our partner companies Bug Out Service in Jacksonville and Skyline Pest Solutions in Atlanta deliver quality service in those areas. We guarantee customer satisfaction to the fullest extent. 
  <br /> 
  <br />The roots of what would become Arrow Environmental Services date back to 1886, when a man named George Pickhardt founded one of the nation's first pest control services near Buffalo, New York. His son, Vern, established Arrow Environmental in Sarasota in 1958, making it one of west Florida's first and longest-established, pest control service companies. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Now under the direction of George's grandson and namesake, company Chairman George Pickhardt, Arrow Environmental Services operates in more than 100 communities in west-central and southwest Florida. 
  <br /> 
  <br />Arrow has been - and continues to be - one of the fastest-growing pest control companies in the nation, as more and more customers join a company built on quality customer service and personal relationships. 
  <br /> 
  <br />We focus on sustainable practices, being especially mindful of the safety of children and pets. Our collaborative style means that we take a wide-ranging approach to addressing your pest control issues. As just one example, a pest problem might have to do with how your landscaping is trimmed around your windows, so that might be the answer instead of simply increasing pest control treatments. 
  <br />Environmental Pest Service, LLC is the parent company of Arrow Environmental Services, Bug Out Service and Skyline Pest Solutions, offering a variety of pest control and lawn care services throughout Florida and Georgia. We are looking for individuals with an entrepreneurship spirit who enjoy working outdoors to fill Service Professional positions on our team.
